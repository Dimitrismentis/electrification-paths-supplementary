Results

In the Split Results file there are 2 tabs. 

Split results: Includes the least cost technology split results for each settlement, including coordinates, country code, projected population for 2030, and technology results for 10 scenarios. Low refers to current diesel price, while high to a projected diesel price according to IEA New Policies Scenario for 2030. 1 to 5 refer to World Bank's Tiers 1 to 5. 

LCOE results: Includes the least cost levelized cost of generating electricity for each settlement, for each scenario.

Datasets

-Algorithms: Detailed information about the algorithm can be found at Mentis et al.,2015.The algorithms used in this analysis will be publicly available in an upcoming version of the tool.  

-GIS Inputs for the scenarios can be found at the file " GIS Input". In the same file, one can also find georeferenced resource availability and costs for diesel and solar stand alone applications. Costs for mini grid and grid options are described further in Fuso Nerini et al.,2016. 

Renewable Resource potentials are available upon request due to large size. Please mail Dimitris Mentis at mentis@kth.se.

Tranmission network

- Existing transmission network: Source: (AfDB, 2011; OSM, 2015) 
- Planned transmission network: The transmission grid is assumed to expand to connect with planned power plants and mining sites (AfDB, 2011; OSM, 2015; USGS, 2015).
